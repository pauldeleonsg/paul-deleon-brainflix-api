While mother nature only allowed for one full run before the conditions made it impossible to ride, that was all that was needed for event veteran Kyle Strait, who won the event for the second time -- eight years after his first Red Cow Rampage title",

That was a huge miss on their part. I’m with you and like the puffy logo on the lace shroud and the heel. These will go in a drop front right next to my DMP 6’s.",

When people started declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdoms in two. Brothers fought brothers, dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered.",

But why? What's the actual reason for it? How did they manage to become more hated than Creed, Insane Clown Posse, and Limp Bizkit all put together? Are they bland and completely unoriginal? Does it have something to do with the frontman Chad Kroeger's behaviour?",

It can escalate to the point where so many people literally come up with extremely detailed conspiracy theories to justify and explain why the world hates the band so much. If you like a certain band, then like that certain band, people tend to rely on other people’s opinions too much.",
